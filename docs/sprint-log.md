# Sprint Log

## 2026-07-12 — The AMG Hub Overhaul (overnight session)

**Mission:** rebrand ODA Hub → AMG Hub (amghub.org), go direct-to-consumer, fix the two
long-broken things (login, cosmetics), reframe teacher tools as kid-solo Learn & Earn games.

**Branch:** `amg-hub` (main untouched; merging + pushing = deploy, Devon's call).

### Commits this session
1. `cd91abc` Checkpoint of ~3 months of uncommitted WIP (trademark renames, Gridiron Rush game, character-creator prototype)
2. `54bdcaf` Audit + plan docs (8-agent parallel audit of all 118K LOC)
3. `df082e0` Full user-facing rebrand + new public landing page + family-accounts UI
4. `e476314` Auth overhaul: session hygiene, anonymous-auth plumbing, hardened rules (staged), classCodes migration
5. `9627cb5` Cosmetics pipeline fix (root cause: equipped vs gameCosmetics tree mismatch) + every dead paid cosmetic implemented + Learn & Earn starter packs wired into 6 tools + coin hooks
6. (this commit) version bump + sprint log + launch checklist polish

### Key decisions (revisitable)
- Internal `oda-*` identifiers/collections stay; only user-facing rebrands (REBRAND_NOTES.md)
- `teachers` collection = guardians (accountType parent|teacher); Family Code == classCode
- Teacher portal = Parent Command Center via label swap for parent accounts
- Renames: Retro Bowl→Gridiron Rush, Jeopardy→Quiz Show (trademark defense)
- Retired from kid hub: Lemonade Day tool (employer program), Builder (author tool)
- Anonymous Firebase auth for kids (invisible), rules v2 staged NOT deployed — deploy order in AMG_HUB_LAUNCH.md

### Verified
- Landing page renders + all login panels flow (live Firestore round-trip tested)
- Stale/forged studentId → clean session-clear → re-login (tested in browser)
- Starter Quiz Show board plays end-to-end kid-solo (5x5 grid rendered, coin path intact)
- All edited pages parse clean (node --check on every inline script)
- 17 fleet agents (audit 8, rebrand 5, cosmetics/repairs 5, learn-earn 4 = 22 total), zero errors

### Open items for Devon
- Review gates + console/DNS steps: docs/AMG_HUB_LAUNCH.md
- Legal peek: pitch.html content still derived from an entrepreneurship curriculum frame (branding stripped)
- southeast-slime.html remains parked/unlinked (confirm what "Southeast" refers to)
- Post-launch: server-authoritative coin awards (Cloud Function) is the real anti-cheat fix
